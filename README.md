## Getting started

For more about how to use Jekyll, check out [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/).
Why Jekyll? Read this [blog post](https://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/)!


### Installation

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*), first [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the theme from `github.com:alshedivat/al-folio` to `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` and do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!).
After you are done, **commit** your final changes.
Now, you can deploy your website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) by running the deploy script:

```bash
$ ./bin/deploy [--user]
```
By default, the script uses the `master` branch for the source code and deploys the webpage to `gh-pages`.
The optional flag `--user` tells it to deploy to `master` and use `source` for the source code instead.
Using `master` for deployment is a convention for [user and organization pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).

**Note:** when deploying your user or organization page, make sure the `_config.yml` has `url` and `baseurl` fields as follows.

```
url:  # should be empty
baseurl:  # should be empty
```


## Features

### Publications

Your publications page is generated automatically from your BibTex bibliography.
Simply edit `_bibliography/papers.bib`.
You can also add new `*.bib` files and customize the look of your publications however you like by editing `_pages/publications.md`.

Keep meta-information about your co-authors in `_data/coauthors.yml` and Jekyll will insert links to their webpages automatically.

### Collections

This Jekyll theme implements `collections` to let you break up your work into categories.
The theme comes with two default collections: `news` and `projects`.
Items from the `news` collection are automatically displayed on the home page.
Items from the `projects` collection are displayed on a responsive grid on projects page.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/img/projects-screenshot.png" width=700></p>

You can easily create your own collections, apps, short stories, courses, or whatever your creative work is.
To do this, edit the collections in the `_config.yml` file, create a corresponding folder, and create a landing page for your collection, similar to `_pages/projects.md`.


### Layouts

**al-folio** comes with stylish layouts for pages and blog posts.

#### The iconic style of Distill

The theme allows you to create blog posts in the [distill.pub](https://distill.pub/) style:

<p align="center"><a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2018/distill/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/distill-screenshot.png" width=700></a></p>

For more details on how to create distill-styled posts using `<d-*>` tags, please refer to [the example](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2018/distill/).

#### Full support for math & code

**al-folio** supports fast math typesetting through [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and code syntax highlighting using [GitHub style](https://github.com/jwarby/jekyll-pygments-themes):

<p align="center">
<a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2015/math/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/math-screenshot.png" width=400></a>
<a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2015/code/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/code-screenshot.png" width=400></a>
</p>

#### Photos

Photo formatting is made simple using [Bootstrap's grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/).
Easily create beautiful grids within your blog posts and project pages:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/projects/1_project/">
    <img src="assets/img/photos-screenshot.png" width="75%">
  </a>
</p>


### Other features

#### Theming
Six beautiful theme colors have been selected to choose from.
The default is purple, but you can quickly change it by editing `$theme-color` variable in the `_sass/variables.scss` file.
Other color variables are listed there as well.




## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.

Hi! I am Stefania. I am currently a second year Ph.D. student 🎓 at the University of Washington Information School, co-advised by Prof. [Amy J. Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/) in the [Code & Cognition Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/lab) and Prof. [Benjamin Mako Hill](https://mako.cc/) in the [Community Data Science Collective](https://wiki.communitydata.science/Main_Page). My research focuses on AI Literacy 📚 and the design of new computing platforms for children and parents. I also enjoy designing and building future smart toys 🤖 and games. When I am not coding & writing papers 👩🏽‍💻 I love hiking, climbing and riding my 🚲.

I am a [Weizenbaum Research Fellow](https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/portrait/p/stefania-druga/) and awardee of the [Jacobs Foundation Grant](https://ischool.uw.edu/news/2020/01/researchers-win-fellowship-study-new-frontier-tech-education). I was previously a [LEGO Papert Fellow](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/meet-the-2017-lego-papert-fellows/) during my time as a master student at MIT researching with Prof. Mitch Resnick and the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) team.

For more information, please [reach out to me](mailto:st3f@uw.edu)! Or have a look at my [projects](https://stefania11.github.io/projects/), [papers](https://stefania11.github.io/publications/), or [resume](https://stefania11.github.io/resume/).

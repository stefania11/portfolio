Hi! I am Stefania. I am currently a second year Ph.D. student 🎓 at the University of Washington in the Informatics department. My research focuses on AI Literacy 📚 and the design of new computing platforms for children and parents. I also enjoy designing and building future smart toys 🤖 and games. 
When I am not coding & writing papers 👩🏽‍💻 I love hiking, climbing and riding my 🚲.

AFRIMAKERS IS AN INITIATIVE THAT WANTS TO ENABLE AFRICAN MAKERS TO USE LOCAL KNOW-HOW AND HANDS-ON PROTOTYPING FOR SOLVING LOCAL CHALLENGES LIKE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER, ENERGY, INFORMATION.
DURING 4 MONTHS LAST YEAR WE KICKSTART MAKER WORKSHOPS FOCUSED ON LOCAL CHALLENGES IN 8 HUBS AROUND AFRICA (KENYA, TANZANIA, RWANDA, ZAMBIA, BOTSWANA, GHANA, NIGERIA, EGYPT).
